# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project required us to create an algorithm using deep q learning to guide an actor toward an end goal while avoiding prohibited areas. We were given the code that dealt with gameflow and "scorekeeping". We were required to create the algorith that actually guided the agent toward the end goal. 


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are in a very wide field that encompasses many disciplines, however, they mostly are involved with creating some sort of deployable program that end users and customers will use. They are involved in the planning, coding, debugging, and upkeep of these programs. 



How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I take a dynamic approach to solving problems when it comes to writing software. I prefer this dynamic approach over static testing because it allows me to test as I go. This means that if there is a problem then I can catch it sooner. It also allows me the opportunity to see a product sooner and adjust any parameters as needed to ensure that a program has the UI that I want. 




What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
There is really no limit to the ethical responsibilities that we owe to the end user and the organization. We should not cause harm to anyone in most situations, however, there are some instances where this is unavoidable. For example, someone working in the defense field creating target acquistion and weapons guidance programs knows that what they create will be used in defense of the United states in some way. THe majority of programs, however, do not harm others. We also owe the end user a sense of security and the implementation of measures to ensure that their data is in fact secure.
